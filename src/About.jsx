                    <p>I love programming because it allows me to bring ideas to life and create solutions to real-world problems. The ability to write code and see it transform into a functional program is truly satisfying. Moreover, programming offers endless opportunities for continuous learning and growth in a rapidly evolving field.
                        I love to solve problems
                        I think a lot and this job requires a lot of thinking so I get to constructively use my best attributes
                        I like to make / build things
                        I enjoy learning new things
                        I like exploring new things (industries, languages, platforms)
                        I like to understand how things work and how they all fit together
